# Algorithm analysis scientific report
The project consists of a comparative study on priority queues. This study looks at the comparison of the AVL algorithm in the balanced binary tree category and the Binary Heap algorithm in the heap category, based on various data sets. Both algorithms are accompanied by advantages and disadvantages, spatial and temporal complexity as well as performance on synthetic datasets.
	Personal gains:
-	getting familiar with the LaTex program in order to create a scientific document
-	understanding the key points in conducting an analysis
